# Name generation using a MLP
These are the two Python files and text files for exercise 2 in the NLP course of the Masters in Theoretical and Applied Linguistics of Pompeu Fabra University.

It trains two Multi-Layer Perceptrons on a different set of names/words each to produce more of them. It then compares the transfer from one to the other.

You must have all 4 files in the same directory. The code you should run is the one in "main". The code is intended to be highly customizable, and there are many parameters you can set. 

By default the code will generate 4 plots and save them to the same adress. This can be changed with a parameter.

Originally the code was not as broken down into functions as it is now, a lot of the code repeated for the second model. I then changed the code into how it is now, using dictionaries and functions. I realise now that it would have been better to use classes and objects. Anyway, I was tired and didn't think of this solution, but the result is more or less the same: the code is prettier (although maybe a bit tangled).
